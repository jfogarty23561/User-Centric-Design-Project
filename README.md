Project Name
User Centric Design Project : TooOld4Gaming website

About
This website is to promote my internet alter ego, TooOld4Gaming. I am a content creator on both YouTube nad Twitch and I do gaming videos and streams. The idea of the website is to showcase my personal side, my mission objective as a content creator, and to also host my Youtube videos and Live Twitch Stream in one place, rather than having to go to them seperately. Essentially, everything I will be doing on other sites can be found on my own web site, centaralaised for the convenience of the user, aka my fan base. It also has external links to go to these sites directly.

UX
I structued this site to be one flowing page, so his wil be more convenient for the user to navigate. As such the nav bar on top does not go to seperate pages, but instantly brings you to the section you are lookng for on the page.

I seperated the different sections into seperate divs, so that they are all distict and easy to see for the user with different colouring from the previous divs. 

I kept every section simple and sleek, and tried not to overstimulate the user. Every section has a purpose, and it is clear to see what each section represents in a second of entering it. Its sleek, easy and accesible.

I used red, black and white as the dominant colours on the page, but smoother versions of each as not to be garish to look at. Keeping a color scheme consistant through the page is again not to overstimulate and also is just pleasing to look at. Red Black and White ane my brands colours also, so I am staying on brand using these throughout the site.

As I was the client for my own website, I knew what I wanted and thus the consulting phase was skipped because of this. I want my fans to be able to access everything I do and can access anything I may do in the future in one place. Maybe in the future get ads on the site and monotize it through clicks and how long they stay on the site.

Features
-Nav bar that brings the user to the section they are looking for
-drop down menu that becomes the nav bar when the project gets to a smaller screen e.g iphone 6
-carousel of photos showcasing my exploits and fun times in the real word (personalized formy fans...when I get them)
-Message section(block of text that can be a changable message to the users, maybe daily/weekly/etc)
-icons for Youtube and Twitch which are also clickable and will bring you to my web pages on both platforms
-a grid section that has my latest youtube videos on it that can be watched from the site itself
-Live twitch feed embeded into the page so when I go live, the user can watch me from there, and interact in chat (Its not my actual twitch stream that is playing for this project, because I would need to be live to showcase it, so I picked a 24 hour music stream which will always be playing to show it is indeed working and is indeed live).


Features Left to Implement
-Merchendise page
-Contact Form
-Social Media links (honestly should have done this, but I am only thinking of it now and I am pretty much out of time)
-Blog (I sort of have this with my message section, but this could be a fully fledged section for users to read about whats happening to me in my personal life)

Technologies Used
-HTML
-CSS
-Bootstrap CSS
-Bootstrap JS
-JS scripts (such as the one used to embed the twitch player) 

Testing
-I tested this project basically by trial and error, I will not lie. What I mean is I would load up the page and see how it looked in different sizes and see if there were any issues.
-one issue I faced was my video grids would start merging together at around 940 width. This took me some time to fix,a nd I tried @media queries in the css, but wouldnt work for me. It ended up being an easy fix in the end, just had to define the width of the iframe to 100% and this stopped them overlapping.
-I used the developer tools in the browser window (Chrome) for basically all of my testing

Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project from https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_band.asp and https://code-institute-solutions.github.io/StudentExampleProjectGradeThree/ for page design
I also did use w3schools for just bits and bobs when figuring out how things worked, and stack overflow when asking very specific questions.
